## Features:

1. **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division:**
   Perform fundamental arithmetic operations with ease.

2. **User-friendly Interface:**
   A clean and intuitive design ensures a straightforward user experience.

3. **Equal Button for Results:**
   Click the equal button to obtain the result of your calculation.

4. **Addition Works Multiple Times:**
   You can perform addition operations multiple times consecutively without pressing the equal button. For example, you can calculate the sum of 50+30+20 directly.

5. **Other Arithmetic Operations:**
   Currently, only addition supports consecutive calculations without pressing the equal button. For subtraction, multiplication, and division, you need to press the equal button after each operation. For example, to calculate 50-30-20, you would need to press the equal button after each subtraction.

## Known Issue (To be Fixed in Future Updates):

1. **Slow Startup:**
   - The initial startup time for version 1.0 may be slower than expected.

2. **Resize Issue:**
   - Resizing functionality may not work as intended in this version.

The current version of the calculator has a limitation where only addition operations can be performed consecutively without pressing the equal button. Subtraction, multiplication, and division operations take only the last two numbers entered and calculate the result accordingly, which may not provide the expected outcome. This issue will be addressed and fixed in future updates to ensure seamless operation across all arithmetic operations.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the project!

## Future Updates:

Calculator 1.0 is just the beginning. Future updates may include additional features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes. Stay tuned for an even better calculator experience!
